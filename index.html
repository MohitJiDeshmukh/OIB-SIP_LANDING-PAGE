        <p class="text-small">Photography is the art, application, and practice of creating durable images by recording
          light, either electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material
          such as photographic film</p>

        <p class="secTag2 text-small">In 1981, Sony unveiled the first consumer camera to use a charge-coupled device
          for
          imaging,
          eliminating the need for film: the Sony Mavica. While the Mavica saved images to disk, the images were
          displayed
          on television, and the camera was not fully digital.

          The first digital camera to both record and save images in a digital format was the Fujix DS-1P created by
          Fujfilm in 1988.

          In 1991, Kodak unveiled the DCS 100, the first commercially available digital single lens reflex camera.
          Although its high cost precluded uses other than photojournalism and professional photography, commercial
          digital photography was born.

          Digital imaging uses an electronic image sensor to record the image as a set of electronic data rather than as
          chemical changes on film.[43] An important difference between digital and chemical photography is that
          chemical
          photography resists photo manipulation because it involves film and photographic paper, while digital imaging
          is
          a highly manipulative medium. This difference allows for a degree of image post-processing that is
          comparatively
          difficult in film-based photography and permits different communicative potentials and applications.</p>

        <p class="secTag2 text-small">Soft Light vs. Hard Light
          Different light sources have different qualities. These qualities are most noticeable in the shadows produced
          on
          photographs. If the light is diffuse, it creates fewer shadows with a softer differentiation between light and
          shadow. This is soft light. While it comes from a source, the light is spread out in many directions from that
          source. That is another way of saying that it isn't directional. A cloudy day is an excellent example of soft
          light. It can be a very desirable look for many images and is usually preferable to hard light.</p>

        <p class="secTag2 text-small">The key to great portrait photography is understanding portrait lighting. This is
          true for natural/ambient light as well as artificial light. In this post, we introduce the basics of
          manipulating studio lighting. Lighting ratios, lighting patterns, angles of view, and facial positions are all
          important factors when creating a flattering portrait.</p>
